## 🚀 **How to Test**

### **Step 1: Setup Firebase**

1. Add `google-services.json` to `android/app/`
2. Enable Firebase Realtime Database in Firebase Console
3. Set database rules to allow read/write (for testing):

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "rides": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": true
    }
  }
}
```

### **Step 2: Run the App**

```bash
flutter run
```

### **Step 3: Test Driver/Rider System**

#### **Device 1 - Driver Mode:**

1. Open the app
2. Tap the **green driver button** (top-right)
3. Grant location permissions
4. App will start sending location to Firebase
5. Status shows "Sending location to Firebase..."

#### **Device 2 - Rider Mode:**

1. Open the app on second device
2. Tap the **blue person button** (top-right)
3. Grant location permissions
4. App will listen for driver location
5. Status shows "Listening for driver location..."

#### **Expected Results:**

- ✅ Driver location appears as **blue marker**
- ✅ Rider location appears as **red marker**
- ✅ **Red polyline** connects both locations
- ✅ **Distance** displayed in app bar
- ✅ Real-time updates every 3 seconds

const int UPDATE_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 3;            // Update frequency
const double DISTANCE_FILTER_METERS = 10.0;      // GPS accuracy filter
```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Location Not Working:**

- Check location permissions in device settings
- Ensure GPS is enabled
- Try the "Get Current Location" button

### **Firebase Not Connecting:**

- Verify `google-services.json` is in `android/app/`
